<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm a front end designer turned front end developer. For the bulk of my Graphic Arts career I’ve designed and produced Business to Business and Business to Consumer catalogs. Print Catalog work has always been a sweet spot of mine. I’ve produced several 400+ page print catalogs cover to cover, including; table of contents, tabs, sections, detailed schematics, indexes, glossaries, etc… Presenting detailed information in a manner that makes sense and looks good is a design challenge that I am always up for. My keen eye and mind, combined with my ability to typeset and image manipulate allows me to produce superior work, in a timely manner. And, since I am a good communicator verbally, I understand what it takes to create effective advertising art.</p>
